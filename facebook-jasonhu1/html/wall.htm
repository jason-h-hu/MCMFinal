http://blogdailyherald.com/2013/05/10/useless-rankings-brown-ranked-thirteenth-on-list-of-happiest-freshmen/
2) I love that BlogDH has writers who are as passionate about this place as I am: 
&quot;A non-competitive ivy-league school seems like an oxymoron, but that seems to be where we go. Brown is a really happy place, in part because it feels like we can do whatever we want to do. It’s not just about open curriculum; it’s about the fact that you can just as easily experience all of Providence life or never leave College Hill; that you can just as easily go to a frat house as a RISD party; that on a given Wednesday night you could be at the sketchiest, most beloved college bar that has ever existed, or in the stacks of the Rock, writing a really great paper on Keats, or in the CIT lounge, doing whatever it is you do there (…seriously what do you do there?). Sometimes going out might actually mean “going out,” but other times it might just mean playing illicit (or non-illicit) games around Nicolas Cage movies. You can be whoever you want to be and be happy at Brown.&quot;

1. lotion spilled in my purse...pretty sure the value of my textbooks dropped about $50. i&#039;m also scared of sticking an oily key into my laptop lock.
2. i stubbed my toe while trying to open the door. i then bled my way back to my dorm room.
3. i got two pieces of garlic bread in the cafeteria. one fell on the ground after i sat down :(
4. my friend lent me a CD and i cracked it. I then freaked out for a while before apologizing...and it had already been cracked. wasted worrying.

then i saw a package. we get them everyday--jk susan does. so i cry. but today i actually did! i got chocolate chip cookies, madelines, orange bread, cranberry-orange scones, blueberry coffee cake, home, nostalgia, and LOVE.

you guys are the best! thanks for being my sunshine :) now i can actually make friends...

I LOVE YOU ALL! &lt;3

Basically the idea was the transfer pop art to sort of Spanglish-y stuff. Not very good because I was drawing it during a choir concert (my fonts are hand drawn and SO FREAKING OFF) and the medium I&#039;m using is pastel rather than screen printing (I&#039;m tempted to make a screen and do it that way but that would take time away from Tapestry), but what do you think of the idea? You&#039;re one of the few artistically inclined people I know... so, yeah. I figured I&#039;d ask. :P. Suggestions for something else?

Yeah, I just realized that if your teacher hasn&#039;t subjected you to that movie, you&#039;ll have no idea what I&#039;m talking about. Oh well, that&#039;s hardly new for me.

I&#039;m out of ideas for the moment, so it&#039;s your turn. Resist the urge to take two and a half months to respond. Pretty sure that in that amount of time, I could find your house and rig it to blast the Jonas Brothers into your room 24/7.

I&#039;ve officially concluded that physical therapists are simultaneously the nicest and most sadistic people on the entire planet. They routinely ask me to do things that I&#039;m relatively certain are anatomically impossible, even if my shoulder was functioning.

I skipped school on Tuesday to go dress shopping for Senior Ball with some of my friends, which was entertaining to say the least - like I said, Senioritis. Growing. Exponentially. And then I got to watch guys get auctioned off at our school&#039;s Mr. GQ on Friday, which is always satisfying from a feminist standpoint, though I wish that so many of them wouldn&#039;t choose singing as their talent when it so blatantly isn&#039;t.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, March 14, 2011 at 12:01am EDT</div>Steph Wraith wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">I&#039;m going to devote an entire post to Fringe, just because you&#039;re pretty much the only person I know besides me who watches it, so I have no one to rant to.

I know that the generally accepted term is Fauxlivia, but I&#039;ve come to prefer &quot;Holivia&quot;, mostly because that&#039;s exactly how I feel about her character. 
And I totally agree with you on:
a) the fabulousness of Walter
b) the immense skill it took on the part of the writers to pull off that whole parallel universe thing... too bad they had to go SCREW UP THE ENTIRE THING BY MAKING HOLIVIA PREGNANT. There, glad I got that out of my system. I believe &quot;soap opera&quot; is the appropriate description, too...

Dear god, was that movie actually any good? I wasn&#039;t masochistic enough to go see it, so I have no idea, although what I saw in the trailer terrified me (and not in a good way). I&#039;ve been making an effort to avoid the movie theater ever since one of my friends coerced me into seeing &quot;Country Strong&quot; with her. I *hate* country music.

For some reason, I don&#039;t have to do a Senior Project, which is nice since I can&#039;t see myself putting that much effort into one even if I did. My senioritis grows worse with each passing week. 

You scream &quot;Swaziland&quot;, so I&#039;m sure that went well. And speaking of screaming, in regards to your comments about squealing over a peacoat, you have given me no choice but to conclude that you&#039;ve gone full hipster.

Random rodent moment of the month (known from here on out as RRMM): I was putting up some signs for Leadership and we saw THE FATTEST SQUIRREL EVER TO LIVE. This thing couldn&#039;t even scamper up a tree when we got close - it had to haul itself up doing this weird pull-hop thing. It was bigger than some cats I&#039;ve worked with at the veterinary hospital. It could asphyxiate you while you slept.

Also, I&#039;m officially loving Disney right now. Not only are they releasing Beauty and the Beast (one of my all-time faves) from the vault just in time for the holidays, but I&#039;m sorta in love with Tangled (the new Rapunzel movie, complete with the voice of Chuck&#039;s Zachary Levi), and I&#039;m fulfilling my annual trip to the Happiest Place on Earth two weeks from now.

Fringe: I can finally stop screaming at my television set every time Peter and Alt-livia (Bolivia? So many options...) are onscreen. I know we&#039;re supposed to be rooting for both universes, but I violently disliked her and that entire plotline. Not as much as I&#039;m disliking the majority of what&#039;s been happening on Glee, but still...

True confession: The baristas at the Starbucks next to my high school have known my name and drink order (depending on the temperature) for two years. You want to talk coffee issues... And if you ever actually purchase/wear a fedora, I will hunt you down and kill you with a pimp cane. I don&#039;t care that we&#039;re friends. Fedoras are the sign of the devil.

This is pretty much where I&#039;m at on Homecoming). Somehow, without fail, both illness and social drama always manage to rear their ugly heads around the time of that illustrious dance.

I feel your high school musical pain, though (wow, that sentence works in so many ways). My school is doing All Shook Up this year, and sophomore year they did Into the Woods. I&#039;m not a fan of Sondheim, and they&#039;re probably not gonna get Cheyenne Jackson to drop by our school to perform the lead in this year&#039;s show, so I&#039;m kinda saddened by the state of things.

I hate them all, and next time, I&#039;m going shopping with the aid of a Zamboni and a grenade launcher. Okay, rant over. Commence the deep, soothing breathing.

Ah, high school. That thing which works to impede me from making progress on The Big C. I&#039;m suffering from early-onset senioritis, sadly, despite the fact that I really do need to maintain good grades for at least four more weeks. For the record, I wondered the exact same thing about &quot;Jersey Thursday&quot; the first time it was mentioned.

First, let&#039;s address the Big C: Christmas shopping. Oh, fine, college is probably what I was actually meaning to talk about, but I&#039;m so traumatized from today&#039;s holiday shopping experience that the college stress has almost left my mind. Oh, nope, wait, there it is again. Basically, it&#039;s reached the point where the pressure has reached a boiling point, and I&#039;ve sort of done the opposite of you: I&#039;ve completely clammed up. It&#039;s literally reached the point where I will refuse outright to discuss applications with my friends. Thanksgiving was hell.

Then I read it today after shopping for a homecoming dress (Why is it that the only thing I can&#039;t withstand peer pressure on is formal dances? Why, I ask you?) and my sympathy has sadly remained in the dressing room, along with all of the unflattering dresses and the last vestiges of my sanity.
- &quot;Where&#039;s the goddamn pesto&quot; = what I&#039;m going to scream the next time a classroom becomes uncomfortably silent.
- Your last sentence was just funny back in May. Now, I read it, and all I can think about is Inception. 
- Why is everyone in college now? It messes with my diabolical kidnapping plans when there are people in LA and Davis. Maybe a roadtrip to Davis is in order...
Anyhow, how are things with you? I think I&#039;ve sufficiently filled the newsfeed. Also, if you&#039;re reading this, hi Brian! (What? You never know...)</div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, October 3, 2010 at 12:11am EDT</div>Steph Wraith wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">Random thoughts from rereading your posts from a long time ago, in a gala- okay, it was only May. Must resist urge to full-on geek out.
- I literally did the exact same thing as you for APUSH. I may have to think all of my religious views. Clearly, there is someone looking out for the crazy nerds.
- You know those bouts of screaming at the tv that we talked about? I had another one during the Fringe finale. And during both of the ones since. Shockingly, they go something along the lines of: &quot;Peter, are you completely brain dead?!?! THAT&#039;S NOT THE REAL OLIVIA, YOU MORON?!&quot; Thank god my family loves me, or I would have been locked up a long time ago...
- The second I read your thing about a marsh, my brain immediately jumped to that line from Monty Python about the castle and the swamp. Then I visualized a ball room sinking and all these people in formal wear beating off alligators with corsages and stilettos. My mind is a scary place.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, October 3, 2010 at 12:04am EDT</div>Steph Wraith wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">The dress-ups for this week, which I have to do (thank you, Leadership...) are all decades, which I thought would be fine until the genius juniors picked the 70s. Seriously, you have second choice of the decades from 1900 to 2000, and you pick the 70s? The decade where everyone&#039;s sense of fashion took a ten-year hiatus? Even the freshmen had the good sense to just pick the 50s so everyone could dress like extras from the set of Grease. Good god, I just said something complementary about freshmen...

I&#039;m catching up on my viewing of Fringe, which is a great deal like taking an electric mixer to one&#039;s brains... interestingly, that may be the only absolutely disgusting thing that Fringe hasn&#039;t tried yet. The muscial episode was awesome (Not as awesome as Buffy&#039;s, but I&#039;m not sure anyone&#039;s gonna top that. There was a song about drycleaning. Automatic win).</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, October 2, 2010 at 11:57pm EDT</div>Steph Wraith wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">In other news, I&#039;ve been busy discovering a hundred and one ways to avoid doing the one thing I should be doing... the apps-which-must-not-be-spoken-of. I found a Very Potter Musical on Youtube... How had I never seen this before? It combines musicals and Harry Potter and features a vaguely gay Voldemort... it is a travesty that this had existed on the internet for so long without my knowledge. 

Homecoming is next week for my school, and it&#039;s a ridiculously big deal this year because our school is turning 100 years old. In other news, the school&#039;s pool is turning 57. Just saying. But, you know, the football field now has a scoreboard with a video screen that can broadcast instant playback, never mind that you can see the plays better by just looking at the game. I&#039;m not bitter...</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, October 2, 2010 at 11:49pm EDT</div>Steph Wraith wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">My new cast of teachers may actually be the best part of this year. I have a Gov teacher who has decreed that every Thursday is &quot;Jersey Thursday&quot;, an Honors Physics teacher who is even more anal than I am (He has a line of tape around his desk where we aren&#039;t allowed to step. I&#039;m not even kidding. Also, a full-sized cutout of Christian Bale from The Dark Knight on the door to his supply closet with a speech bubble that says &quot;Do Not Enter&quot;), an AP Stats teacher whose wife is a nutritionist (he has an entire cabinet filled with food at the school), and an AP Lit teacher who has a shawl in every color of the rainbow who literally told us on Friday that the placement of every comma has a hugely important meaning. Seriously, where do they find these people?</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, October 2, 2010 at 11:43pm EDT</div>Steph Wraith wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">Of course, senior year has its upsides:
-All of my teachers seem to have embraced the fact that if they give seniors too much homework, we&#039;ll just drop the class instead of trying. Adios, late nights working on ridiculous history essays and bio labs. Oh, how I shall not miss you.
-We didn&#039;t have a full week of school until four weeks into the school year. Gotta love going to Water World three weeks in for no apparent reason. Other than the Dippin&#039; Dots, which I suppose should be reason enough.
-I feel even *less* guilty about elbowing freshmen out of my way in order to get to class on time.
-One of my teachers accidentally marked me absent, my mom got a call about me cutting... and she didn&#039;t even seem that upset. This may be the most amazing thing on this list.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, October 2, 2010 at 11:38pm EDT</div>Steph Wraith wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">Hey back at you! Why have we not talked in so long? I could offer up a list of highly implausible reasons involving kidnappings and violent carnivorous animals, but that would make it seem like I live a far more exciting life than I do. Reality: Senior year is insane. Vastly preferable to junior year, but still, you know, insane. 

Anyhow, insanity aside, it&#039;s very strange to realize that we&#039;re almost a quarter of the way through senior year. Every time someone mentions the word &quot;college&quot;, I have to run away and hide under a rock somewhere. This might explain why I have no friends...</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, October 1, 2010 at 2:33pm EDT</div>Melodie Davis wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">Hey so I watched my first 3 Doctor Who episodes ever today! :D</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, October 1, 2010 at 4:00pm EDT</div>Jason Hu went to Football Game against Mountain View.</p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, September 30, 2010 at 1:13am EDT</div>Justin Koehler wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">Yes!

Wow, that was one hell of a run-on sentence.

All these critics base their arguments off of the same societal presumptions.  &quot;The first big breeder, Fermi I, nearly exploded in Monroe, Michigan, in 1966, threatening to irradiate the entire Great Lakes region.&quot;  He doesn&#039;t need to prove that a spill would have had any significant environmental impact.  He just has to say &quot;nuclear power plant explosion&quot; and people automatically jump to the conclusion of &quot;three-eyed fish&quot;.

That one was a bonus. Or just therapeutic. You decide) which is probably enough to cover your entire wall and annoy all mutual friends, so I suppose I should stop. Three more things:
1. Ironically, I like kids. I guess I just don&#039;t like those specific kids. Or, I hate trampolines. Either way, it&#039;s hilarious that you remember them.
2. I am once again on the warpath. There will be a reunion at the start of summer. If my plans are once again thwarted, I cannot be held accountable for my own actions. I am unstable, frequently over-caffeinated, and the owner of two very enthusiastic canines and a small car with a large trunk. Be afraid. You have been warned.
3. Trust me, we aren&#039;t well-adjusted members of society. The fact that I just wrote #2, and the fact that you won&#039;t report it to the authorities, clearly demonstrates that we are mentally unstable. And all the more awesome because of it.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, May 17, 2010 at 11:58pm EDT</div>Steph Wraith wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">And speaking of holes, how about Portland? I&#039;m joking, I&#039;m joking... but alas, I have spent far too much time in that particular city (Some of my grandparents live there) to truly appreciate its wonders. Although I am intimately, painfully aquainted with both the science museum and the hospital there. That came out far scarier than I intended it to... my grandparents work at the hospital. I&#039;ve never had to go there for medical reasons. At least, none that I remember... moving on.

But that does sound like all kinds of fun, Portland or no. I would totally appreciate the nerdy grammar jokes too, don&#039;t worry. And for the record, embrace your inner hipster. You know it&#039;s true. Me, I&#039;m clinging desperately to my upcoming vacation to the Dominican Republic as a way to survive the next 4 weeks... think of it as a sunny, white sand life raft that&#039;s carrying me away from the Titanic shipwreck that was most of junior year.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, May 17, 2010 at 11:52pm EDT</div>Steph Wraith wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">I have a feeling that my school&#039;s journalism group didn&#039;t go to Portland... as I&#039;ve explained before, they aren&#039;t the most illustrious group of students. Just last week, I was pulled back in (I swear to god, it&#039;s like the mafia - once you&#039;re in, you can never get out. That one semester of newspaper will haunt me forever) to write a letter to the editor. They literally have to ask people to write these things, otherwise no one will. Sad, but true.

I really love the LOTR references that keep showing up, by the way. Although if you&#039;re Gandalf and I&#039;m a Ring Wraith, we&#039;re gonna have a problem at some point. That may be the nerdiest sentence I&#039;ve ever written. All that I need to do is tag a &quot;Shiny!&quot; to the end of it to reach true legendary nerd status.

For the record, though, my friends do have the capacity to make that chick from the second X-Men movie look like she just needs a quick nail trim. Which can be amusing, when not directed at you. I feel like some government official is going to stumble upon this post and kidnap my friends for use in some special high-class military operation. Could I be more geeky? I think not. Speaking of which, no need to explain the appeal of a bookstore to me. This is the girl who&#039;s obsessed with the smell of new books... trust me, I get it.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, May 17, 2010 at 11:41pm EDT</div>Steph Wraith wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">But yes, AP exams are now over, which is a beautiful thing. And after three solid days of avoiding end-of-year projects in favor of cheesy chick flicks (Letters to Juliet would have Love Story in the soundtrack just to mock me...) my brain has returned to semi-normal. I feel that I, too, should start giving random shout-outs to BriBri since he will no doubt read this post when it clogs up his news feed. Hi Brian!

Now to turn my attention to other happy things. Like the fact that summer is finally only four weeks away, which may be the best thing I&#039;ve ever heard in my entire life. Or the fact that the Spanish teacher I&#039;ve passionately loathed all year has not been asked to return (What can I say, I&#039;m evil and vindictive. I wasn&#039;t even going to have her next year, and I still wanted her gone). Or the fact that within the next week, I might even actually send you those pictures...</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, May 17, 2010 at 11:36pm EDT</div>Steph Wraith wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">So, your prediction about me being held hostage by AP testing came horribly, gruesomely true... Which is why I&#039;m replying (almost) a month later. Yay for staring blankly at a textbook trying desperately to recall if you have, in fact, absorbed any knowledge at all the entire year. (Answer: Yes. On the AP US History Exam, you will know all about the Salem Witch Trials because you just watched The Crucible in English. You will know absolutely nothing else. Congratulations) In all honesty, I didn&#039;t even do that great a job of studying... instead, I sat around doing things to distract myself from how nervous I was about the fact that I didn&#039;t study. At one point, I even kidnapped one of my friends and made her go to Iron Man 2 with me. Because that&#039;s totally the best way to prepare for the AP Bio exam...</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, May 17, 2010 at 1:26am EDT</div>Jason Hu posted something via Tumblr.</p><p><div class="meta">Monday, May 17, 2010 at 1:15am EDT</div>Kelsey Chandler Ayers wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">i made eclairs and im bringing them to babb. i am such a suck up ahhaha</div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, May 16, 2010 at 12:32am EDT</div>Aimee Dang wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">so it looks like its gonna be cloudy tomorrow morning

I think a part of my soul just died. That is all.

Except, because it&#039;s me, that&#039;s never all. Number one: to the writers of that article, Zac Efron should never be equated to chocolate - that is heresy. Number two: Captain Reynolds/Hammer trumps Troy Whatever-the-hell-his-last-name-was-who-couldn&#039;t-sing-or-act. Every time. Number three: In defense of Zac Efron, there has only ever been and will only ever be one true &quot;man-bangs&quot;, and his name is Chase Crawford. His man-bangs make Zac look like he has a buzz-cut.

Ah, the school newspaper. I assume, as you are in charge of yours and this is exciting, that it is of a much higher caliber than &quot;The Wolfprint&quot;, my school paper. Of course, at my school they have to bribe and blackmail people to join, so what do you expect?

Well, you may have had a cult passing stuff out, but my school has been in the midst of student body elections. A far scarier cult, but still with the t-shirts.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, April 7, 2010 at 5:04am EDT</div>Stefan Tian wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">Q1-Q10,

- Visual of your hair trying to strangle you = legendary. Although I&#039;m pretty sure your hair is actually too short to accomplish such a task, unless you&#039;ve either gotten extensions or taken some serious hair steroids since the last time I saw you. That would be unfortunate.

The problem is that if I criticize her for the fact that she can&#039;t sing, then I&#039;m being hypocritical.

You can decide which is the 1 and which is the 0.5).

Regarding sixth grade singing: I was not indie. I was not avante-garde.  I was, to use your words, &quot;just dreadful&quot;. People were just too polite to mention it. So now I restrict my singing to when I&#039;m in the car blasting the radio. Then I can&#039;t hear my own voice. Plus, I&#039;ve discovered that on some of the truly autotuned songs, they cover such a wide range of notes in the melody because of digital enhancement that you can pretty much sing whichever pitch you want and you&#039;ll be on key.

Or someone else&#039;s. I&#039;m pretty sure that the stilettos could be used as a murder weapon. 

I am so with you on the senioritis thing. Any time one of the seniors in any of my classes mentions that they only have a few months left, I give them a death glare. Speaking of which, you&#039;re so right. The campus of my high school is actually littered with petrified underclassmen... it looks kind of like the White Witch&#039;s courtyard in Narnia.

Also, I so don&#039;t want to do homework right now, and this is way more fun) the dreaded prom season has descended upon my school... Run for your life! I jest... except that I really, really don&#039;t. My loathing of dances has reached something of a state of infamy, but I have some truly tenacious, semi-intimidating friends (You think I&#039;m scary? You need to meet some of these people) who have assured me that I&#039;m going, either of my own volition, or bound, gagged, and sedated. Yay!

So I spent about two hours today trying on an assortment of dresses that ranged from &quot;Makes me look like a fourty-year-old soccer mom&quot; to &quot;Makes me look like a really *expensive* hooker&quot;. Which was fun. But I did eventually find one which didn&#039;t make me look like a hooker or a linebacker, but did cost more than double my mother&#039;s wedding dress. She&#039;s very proud.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, February 20, 2010 at 7:34pm EST</div>Steph Wraith wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">You&#039;re so right about the book thing, though.

Because really, how hard is it to improve on Jane Austen?). 

And for the record, if you went to see &quot;Stephanie on Ice&quot;, I might have to return your money... there&#039;s a very good reason that I&#039;m a swimmer. Remember the whole &quot;Mobility Impaired&quot; thing? Yeah, now visualize that on ice. It would be so, so bad. Although, I imagine it would actually be pretty funny to watch. Just not so funny for me. Although I&#039;m pretty sure that I could find some really great costumes for it - I&#039;ve been watching the Olympics (the best thing ever to happen to sick people, which is what I was last week) and some of those ice-skating outfits are hilarious.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, February 20, 2010 at 7:28pm EST</div>Steph Wraith wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">I do love the theme music from the Pirates movies though...

Haha, I wish that I hadn&#039;t returned the bacon scarf... had I known that anyone on the planet actually wanted to possess such an item, I surely would have kept it to give to you. I do like your family&#039;s gift-giving process - it&#039;s actually essentially what my family does, since I wind up returning almost everything and buying new stuff. My favorite relatives are the ones who have wised up and just give me giftcards. Especially to book stores.

I did try a few episodes of Torchwood (which I think is somehow associated with Doctor Who) but it just didn&#039;t work for me... probably because my scifi ick factor is fully filled by Fringe. Or, because there were no cute guys.

I can neither confirm nor deny the presence of a &quot;Disneyland curse&quot;, since shortly after sixth grade I realized that I had a horrible singing voice (still not sure why no one told me this) and that I was far more talented at being OCD and telling people what to do. So I switched from choir to Leadership.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, February 20, 2010 at 7:16pm EST</div>Steph Wraith wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">After your comment, I have officially decided to start my own college in Antarctica.

Sadly, studying with penguins would probably actually be preferable to studying with some of my classmates. Somehow my &quot;I am Switzerland&quot; memo seems to have not been properly distributed this year, which means that I&#039;ve been subjected to a whole truckload of catty teenage girl drama. And you know how I love drama - about as much as I love cheerleaders. And sonnets (Except for yours, which was hilarious, and totally made my day. In response, I write this:

In spite of my love for accents and space
Doctor Who isn&#039;t on my Tivo queue
My love for Firefly I can&#039;t erase
And now I have Fringe, and Eureka, too.

That was ridiculously difficult.

But on the plus side, I am so desperate to have a COSMOS reunion that I have decided that my next psycotic-obsession-mission will be to get everyone together for Spring Break. If this involves blackmail or kidnapping, so be it.

The worst part of that is that I probably actually would go driving around the Bay Area kidnapping people and dragging them to a frozen yogurt store. And speaking of driving, who ever said that you had to drive well to get a license? I have a friend who drove on the wrong side of the road and still got hers (two tests later, though... the DMV does have some standards, and I believe the ability to tell right from left is still one of them).

We were supposed to sleep on the way there and wake up energized and ready to enter the park, but the teacher insisted on playing some exceptionally loud, poorly written scifi movie on the bus, so I woke up every 15 minutes to the sound of gunfire.

And now this is making me think of school, which is exactly what I&#039;ve been avoiding for all of break...

I&#039;m glad you got to see the Firefly reference... it was hilarious, because I wasn&#039;t actually looking for it, I was just watching the show, and at first I was wondering if I&#039;d turned the wrong thing on by mistake. There was a more subtle &quot;two by two, hands of blue&quot; reference a while ago that was also entertaining. I&#039;m glad Nathan Fillion has a new show where I can watch him, but I secretly still hope that by some miracle, Firefly will be brought back. Impossible, I know, and yet.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, December 29, 2009 at 4:57pm EST</div>Steph Wraith wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">It&#039;s a good thing you explained your bizarre formatting, because otherwise I might have thought that the poetry thing was intentional, and would have been forced to respond with a sonnet...

Puppy chow, muddy buddies... tomayto, tomahto. Does it matter when it&#039;s so amazingly tasty? And also, one of the only food items that I have the ability to cook?

My condolences to your garden herbs. Does this mean that you, too, had snow fall upon your town? It was fairly amazing here in Danville, the land of snows-maybe-once-every-seven-years. The downtown looked postcard-perfect, and the high school was beautiful... until the freshmen started throwing snowballs. At which point I adopted my famed &quot;you hit me and you die&quot; facial expression. Also, snow is amazing and gorgeous, until it starts to melt, at which point I hate it with the fiery passion of a thousand suns as it drips off of the roof and onto my head. This makes my desire to go to a college on the east coast something of a problem... though if I go somewhere cold enough, the snow might never melt.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, December 27, 2009 at 8:10pm EST</div>Miranda Adams wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">thanks! and don&#039;t worry, I had very delicious cake:] (upside down spiced pear cake!)

-The &quot;Glee&quot; finale was one of the best hours of tv ever created. Fact.

For a while there, I thought wall posts could go on indefinitely, which would have been exciting..... which is proof of just how exciting my life has been the past few months. On the plus side, missing a cumulative two weeks of school due to illness allowed me to watch every episode of firefly (again), which was fairly awesome. I&#039;d forgotten just how awesome that show was (There was a great Firefly reference in the Halloween episode of Castle... I don&#039;t know if you watch that show...).

I have mastered the art of making Muddy Buddies, which are delicious.

I also pissed off the rest of my reading group by requesting that we read &quot;East of Eden&quot; in the first place, as it is a mere 600 pages. Their fault for not standing up to me and demanding a shorter classic to read. My school has started a Harry Potter Club, which I found hilarious until I began to worry that it would establish the precedent for a Twilight Club...

That&#039;s pretty much all that comes to mind right now.

&quot;Glee&quot; = pure awesomeness. I have been in love with it since they aired the pilot after the AI finale, and I swear it gets better each episode. Although the one with football and &quot;Single Ladies&quot; is probably my favorite so far.

I do have a weak defense for the whole &quot;quote&quot; mishap. I was typing how I talk, but because I too am a grammar nazi, I added the punctuation. Hence, redundancy. However, no punch coming your way, due to the prolonged time it took me to respond.

And speaking of ice breakers, name games, bonding, and teaching (Oh my!) I just spent the entire day at freshman orientation, doing those exact things with freshmen... half of whom were taller than me... no comment.

With regards to the whole credits thing... I only do it for easter eggs too. But those credits are LONG!

3. I was kidnapped by rabid squirrels from Mars and forced to watch reruns of Hannah Montana until I passed out from horror... which was approximately 10 minutes into the first episode.

one or two seasons, unlike virtually everything else that Joss Whedon has ever done, it actually does start to suck at a certain point. The first three seasons are awesome (Don&#039;t worry, I&#039;m not biased at all because of the presence of Angel...) and then Riley shows up for seasons 4 and 5 and everything kind of goes to hell (no not-particularly-funny pun intended). And then Spike shows back up and Riley leaves, and there&#039;s a musical episode, and it&#039;s all good again for the last two seasons. 

I am, of course, basing this assesment of the show off of a highly detailed analysis of its writing, acting, and plot... not off of when the two hot vampires that I like appear in the story line. Of course not - that would be wildly unprofessional and immature.

But yes, to truly be a Whedon fan, at least some amount of Buffy-watching is necessary. You actually kind of went at it backwards. Most people find Buffy, then Firefly.

I&#039;ve made it my goal with this post not to hit word limit, so we&#039;ll see how that goes. Then I can make fun of you, rather than the other way around. Anyhow, singing firefly episode = every joss whedon fan&#039;s greatest dream. It would even manage to top the buffy one, which is, to date, my favorite musical episode ever. And I&#039;m so glad that you can now visualize me talking. Not sure about the wide eyed thing. I usually reserve</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, August 5, 2009 at 6:52pm EDT</div>Steph Wraith wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">Haha, word limit again.

that I can actually stand. Not sure what that says about me as a person... pretty sure I don&#039;t want to know. Actually, that&#039;s not true - I liked Kreacher in the last book too, and he didn&#039;t die (that I know of). Or, a la Breaking Dawn, I could randomly impregnate a character... that would be entertaining. I can feel the plot of a bad scifi movie forming already... some strange combination of wizards, vampires, and Juno. Sure to be an instant classic. Not really sure what the title of that would be... maybe we could add spaceships or freezerays as a nod to the awesomeness that is Joss Whedon (or at least the awesomeness he would be if he could just pull together a Firefly reunion).

Works for me either way. And I maintain that my theory still stands, because this time I was online first, lying in wait if you will, and not the other way around. I still think that every time I sign on, all cosmos people sign off... the trick is to be online first. 

Important personality note: I (almost) never lie. Overexaggerate, yes, although in this case that was hardly necessary. Lie, not so much. Although, sadly, both the epic camping trips and the gratuitous killing off of fan favorite characters was not present in my last post. I suppose I could kill off Luna or something in this one, but I don&#039;t have the heart since she&#039;s pretty much the only character left alive besides Hermione</div></p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, August 4, 2009 at 9:38pm EDT</div>Jason Hu changed his Music.</p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, August 4, 2009 at 7:32pm EDT</div>Varsha Gupta wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">JASPON

Keep in mind:



-no “padded” envelopes or packages, only letters



-it will cost around $1.50 for a letter (check online!)



-it will take around 3-4 weeks to get to me, as for my letter to get to you.

YES that&#039;s probably a good idea, no?
we need to bring the 2 lists, one on what schools can do &amp; what on what the district can do. &amp; probably focusing on education since i think that&#039;s what we&#039;re signed up for-? 
i&#039;ve already typed up most of the ideas we brainstormed w/ mvhs, so i can send that out to u guys by this weekend &amp; we can look it over &amp; see if we need to add. i can also send it out to the club in case they have any last ideas.

The experiment took place at the Skaramagas naval base outside Athens. On this occasion 70 mirrors were used, each with a copper coating and a size of around five by three feet (1.5 by 1 m). The mirrors were pointed at a plywood mock-up of a Roman warship at a distance of around 160 feet (50 m). When the mirrors were focused accurately, the ship burst into flames within a few seconds. The plywood ship had a coating of tar paint, which may have aided combustion.[32]

Sounds like  we just might be able to burn some stuff… assuming we have access to 70 copper coated mirrors that are 1.5 by 1 m…

As for music, QC is all over the place. They touch on metal, which you probably aren&#039;t interested in, super-indie stuff, are in love with Stephen Malkmus, who was a part of Pavement, some more electronic stuff (Brian Eno, who is super ambient. Check out Music for Airports to see what I mean.)

If you want, look up LCD Soundsystem or TV on the Radio. They&#039;re in my iTunes somewhere, I just never got around to listening to them.

Ooh. And Joshua Radin has a new album out - Simple Times. The single is: I&#039;d Rather Be With You.

Overall I thought I got about 65/80 problems correct; I left 5 blank, guessed on about 10... so I feel pretty confident.  I&#039;m sure that after Bio AP this will be super easy for us.

I am very jealous of your PE class... since I haven&#039;t had general anestesia for a week I should be able to start physical education again after 4 weeks back.  I don&#039;t know how I&#039;m supposed to make all of those hours up though... momentarily I have an IV stand next to me and three tubes are entering my arm.   I feel  a lot better than before, I can walk now, eat food, and poop.  Compared to a week ago, I am a new person!

see you soon, I&#039;m excited to see everyone.... hopefully in a week or 2</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, September 21, 2007 at 2:22am EDT</div>Jason Hu updated his status.<div class="comment">still working</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, September 21, 2007 at 2:00am EDT</div>Jason Hu updated his status.<div class="comment">saying to guy Alex, &quot;No, Bitch.&quot;</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, September 21, 2007 at 1:55am EDT</div>Jason Hu updated his status.<div class="comment">running with the devil</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, September 21, 2007 at 12:35am EDT</div>Shannon Bray wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">o that sux</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, September 21, 2007 at 12:20am EDT</div>Shannon Bray wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">do u really have that much hw or is it something else?</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, September 21, 2007 at 12:13am EDT</div>Sarah-Anne Noslen wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">y are u up so late??</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, September 20, 2007 at 11:21pm EDT</div>Jason Hu updated his status.<div class="comment">probably working until twelve</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, October 13, 2007 at 8:00pm EDT</div>Jason Hu went to 2007 Homecoming Dance.</p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, October 13, 2007 at 11:30am EDT</div>Jason Hu went to 2007 Homecoming Game.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, September 19, 2007 at 9:18pm EDT</div>Jason Hu updated his status.<div class="comment">speeching and debating</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, September 27, 2007 at 9:00pm EDT</div>Jason Hu went to THE OFFICE Season 4 Premiere.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, September 19, 2007 at 7:51pm EDT</div>Jason Hu updated his status.<div class="comment">working and also watching Ugly Betty</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, September 19, 2007 at 7:51pm EDT</div>Carolyn Yang wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">y r u running with the devil?</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, September 19, 2007 at 7:12pm EDT</div>Jason Hu updated his status.<div class="comment">running with the devil again</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, September 19, 2007 at 12:54am EDT</div>Carolyn Huang wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">hey there!

anyways, um...xcountry is somewhat serious, not really though. There are going to be people who&#039;s faster than you (not me, i&#039;m a slug) that&#039;s on varsity. Don&#039;t worry about them: the nice ones will help you and cheer you on, the evil ones will boo at you and make you feel bad about yourself.

but if you join in your freshmen year, and say that you&#039;re a newbie in lahs xcountry, the our coach (patty sue) will go easy on you and put you in the &#039;newbie&#039; group (i was in that group xD). We usually did like, 2 times less than the junior varsity people and we can take it easier than most people. 

Join! it&#039;ll be hella fun xD cause teresa and julia are doing field hockey...(darn them...) but i have a friend who did both cross country and field hockey (even though they were in the same season)

you&#039;re doing band next year, right?</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, August 1, 2007 at 12:11pm EDT</div>Jason Hu updated his status.<div class="comment">bored and wishing that he had something to do</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, August 1, 2007 at 12:07pm EDT</div>Jason Hu and Kellie K.
